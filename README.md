# Genomic selection for genotype performance and stability using information on multiple traits and multiple environments

## J. Bancic, B. Ovenden , G. Gorjanc, D.J. Tolhurst

Note that the manuscript is currently under revision, so improvements in code are still expected. Find preprint here: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1836102/v1

This repository contains two scripts to perform statistical analysis in the paper:
1. RScript_fitting - contains code to run the statistical models in ASReml-R 
2. RScript_interpretation - contains code to obtain model summaries with references to equations presented in the manuscript  

The raw rice multi-trait MET dataset will be made available at the New South Wales Government data repository (https://data.nsw.gov.au).

If you find error in the code, do not hesitate to reach us on email jbancic@ed.ac.uk and D.J.Tolhurst@sms.ed.ac.uk.
